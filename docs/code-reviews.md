This program is desined to have code reviews after you complete each phase. In order for code reviews to work, you are required to push your code to [GitHub](https://github.com). Once you do that, just send a link to your GitHub repository to the person reviewing your code in Discord. If you want, and time is available, we can set up a code review on live chat. Otherwise the code review can be written. 

## Commits
Creating frequent commits is very important; it acts like a "save point" in your code. At the very least, you should be commiting once per phase with a useful commit message. A _useful commit message_ would be a one sentence message that describes the changes in that commit. So maybe one of your commit messages is "completed phase 1 tasks", or "added navigation when a user clicks a nav bar item".

Commits act as a form of documentation, they can help other developers understand the purpose of the code. They also help code reviewers review code since they can know what task / phase your code belongs to. Please add commits as frequent as possible!
