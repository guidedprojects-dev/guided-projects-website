## Who is This For?

Since you will be doing all of the programming in this project, you need to be comfortable with React and JavaScript. Meaning you should know the basics: how to create a new React project, how to route to pages in a "single page application", understand the basics of state management, etc. You don't need to be entirely comfortable, but I am afraid you might feel lost if you haven't been working with the framework. If you look at phase one and think you can handle most of the action items yourself, you are in the right place.
