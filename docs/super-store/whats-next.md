There is still more to come for this project! I am actively working on developing more phases as there is a lot more that I want to add to Super Store.

Here is a list of a few things that will be coming: 
- User Login
- Item Cart chaching to persist data between sessions
- An actual checkout flow
- Real customer reivews and ratings
- An API task list so you can build out the API layer.

It takes me a little bit of time to get the phases done since I put a lot of time and effort into them. I build out everything myself first to make sure it is all reasonable and I can personally know where problem points might occur so I can be better help to everyone. But stay tuned, I'm excited to add more content! ðŸ˜ƒ
